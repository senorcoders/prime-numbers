# Prime Number Matrix
This project is something you may find extremely useful if ever stuck in the desert with nothing to do.  Choose the number of Prime numbers (N) that you would like to create a matrix with.  Fantastic!

## Getting Started
This app uses python 2.7.  What a dream.

### Prerequisites 
Python 2.7+ is required to run this app.  This app will not run using Python 3+.  If you are using  a Mac, it comes with python 2.7 out of the box.  If not, visit [the python site](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/) to download it.

## Running the program
>ex. python index.py 10

## Running tests
> python index.py test

This will test the main function of the application isPrime().  Can it decipher between a prime number and a non-prime number.

## Versioning
